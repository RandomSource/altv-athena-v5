Plugin by Stuyk

## Installation

Take the contents of this `.zip` file and place them into the following directory:

```
./src/core/plugins/private-pm-keybind-menu
```

Run the framework, and you should see the plugin registered in the startup, or you can go in-game and press `ESCAPE` to see the pause menu.

**Important**

If you renamed your `private-pause-menu` you will need to fix the imports in this plugin.

## What is this?

It's a way to override keybinds that are bound through the `AthenaClient.hotkeys` method.

Any key can be used on an English keyboard. Other keyboards may not work.
